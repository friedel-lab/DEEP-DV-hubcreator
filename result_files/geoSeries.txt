GSE115829,EBV,PARP1 Stabilizes CTCF Binding and Chromatin Structure to Maintain Epstein Barr Virus Latency Type,Public on Jun 27 2018,Jun 14 2018,Feb 08 2022,29976663; 35039491,"Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is a potentially oncogenic gammaherpesvirus that establishes a chronic, latent infection in memory B cells. The EBV genome persists in infected host cells as a chromatinized episome and is subject to chromatin-mediated regulation. Binding of the host insulator protein CTCF to the EBV genome has an established role in maintaining viral latency type. CTCF is post-translationally modified by the host enzyme PARP1. PARP1, or Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, catalyzes the transfer of a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) moiety from NAD+ onto acceptor proteins including itself, histone proteins, and CTCF. PARylation of CTCF by PARP1 can affect CTCF’s insulator activity, DNA binding capacity, and ability to form chromatin loops. Both PARP1 and CTCF have been implicated in the regulation of EBV latency and lytic reactivation. Thus, we predicted that pharmacological inhibition with PARP1 inhibitors would affect EBV latency type through a chromatin-specific mechanism. Here, we show that PARP1 and CTCF colocalize at specific sites throughout the EBV genome, and provide evidence to suggest that PARP1 acts to stabilize CTCF binding and maintain the open chromatin landscape at the active Cp promoter during type III latency. Further, PARP1 activity is important in maintaining latency type-specific viral gene expression. The data presented here provide a rationale for the use of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of EBV-associated cancers exhibiting type III latency, and could ultimately contribute to an EBV-specific treatment strategy for AIDS-related or post-transplant lymphomas.",Two biological replicates of LCL FAIRE or just sonicate DNA (input) were used to make ChIP-seq libraries.  For peak calling we compare the FAIRE enrichment to the input signal.; This series includes PARP1 and CTCF ChIP-seq of EBV.,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Lena,N,Lupey-Green; Lisa,B,Caruso; Jozef,,Madzo; Kayla,A,Martin; Yinfei,,Tan; Michael,,Hulse; Italo,,Tempera",GSM3191485; GSM3191486; GSM3191487; GSM3191488; GSM3191489; GSM3191490; GSM3191491; GSM3191492,"Italo,,Tempera",Tempera@temple.edu,Temple University,"3307 N.

GSE128258,HSV-1,"The CCCTC binding factor, CTRL2, controls heterochromatin deposition and the establishment of HSV-1 latency in vivo",Public on Apr 05 2019,Mar 13 2019,Apr 07 2019,NA,"The cellular insulator  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) plays a role in HSV-1 latency through the establishment of chromatin boundaries. We previously found that the CTRL2 regulatory element downstream from the LAT enhancer  is bound by CTCF during latency and undergoes CTCF eviction at early times post-reactivation in mice latent with 17Syn+ . It has been previously shown that the CTRL2 binding domain is a functional insulator with both enhancer-blocking and silencing capabilities. Considering these findings, we hypothesized that the CTRL2 site plays a key role in regulating latent HSV-1 gene expression. To test this, we used a mutant virus with a 135 bp deletion spanning only the core CTRL2 domain (DCTRL2) in the 17Syn+ background. Following ocular infection of mice, we found significant differences between DCTRL2 and wild-type virus during the acute infection and latency. Notably, mouse mortalities were significantly higher in the DCTRL2 virus compared to the 17Syn+, while lower viral genomes were found after latency indicating that deletion of CTRL2 site disrupted latency establishment.  This fact, coupled with increased LAT intron and VP16 expression indicated that the establishment of latency was disrupted in the DCTRL2 mutant. These data provide evidence that chromatin domains of the latent HSV-1 genome are in part maintained by the CTRL2 binding.",4-6 weeks of age BALB/c mice were anesthetized using intramuscular injections of ketamine and xylazine infected with 2 different strains of HSV1 (WT and DeltaCTRL2) in the corneal epithelium.
