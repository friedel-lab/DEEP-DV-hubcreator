##### Start of questions #####

Q: How can I open or close samples for a series/study?
A: The first column of the series (usually the GSE/SRP number) contains the symbol "⯈". Just click this symbol and the corresponding samples/runs will appear. If you want to close it again
just click "⯅" (which appears when samples/runs are opened) or click the <i>RESET</i> button (caution: everything will be reseted then!).

Q: How can I show the complete text of a table cell?
A: If the text of a table cell is cut off, you can make the whole text visible by clicking on <b>+</b> at the beginning of the text. If the text is fully shown, you can close it 
again by clicking <b>-</b> (which appears when text is completely shown).

Q: How do I open and close the filter panel?
A: To filter the meta data, simply click on the button called <b>Filter</b> in the top left corner. A filter panel will appear at the left side of your screen. To close the filter
panel again, click on a different location of your screen or use the "<b>↩</b>" button in the top left corner of the filter panel. 

Q: How can I reset the page?
A: If you have e.g. filtered and now want to reset the page, open the filter panel and click on the button, called <b>Reset</b>, in the top right corner of the filter panel.

Q: What are the different filter options for GEO and internal data and how do I filter?
A: If you open the filter panel with the <b>Filter</b> button, you can see three different filter options: <b>Series filter</b>, <b>Sample filter</b> and <b>Any term</b> at the top 
of the filter panel. The currently selected filter option is shown on a dark blue background. By clicking on the corresponding filter option, you can open filter criterias for the 
series meta data, sample meta data or look out for any matching term. You can use multiple of the different filter criterias for one filter option: e.g. you can use both <i>title</i>
and <i>summary</i> to filter the series meta data. Only series that match both criterias will remain.

Q: What are the different filter options for SRA data and how do I filter?
A: If you open the filter panel with the <b>Filter</b> button, you can see three different filter options: <b>Study filter</b>, <b>Run filter</b> and <b>Any term</b> at the top 
of the filter panel. The currently selected filter option is shown on a dark blue background. By clicking on the corresponding filter option, you can open filter criterias for the 
study meta data, run meta data or look out for any matching term. You can use multiple of the different filter criterias for one filter option: e.g. you can use both <i>title</i>
and <i>summary</i> to filter the study meta data. Only studies that match both criterias will remain.

Q: I filtered the sample/run meta data, but there are samples/runs which don't fullfill the filter criteria?
A: This is an artifact of the filter algorithm. If only one of the samples/runs from a series/study matches the filter criteria, the series/study and all other samples/runs will be shown. Same story for
the anyterm filter.

Q: How does the date filter criteria work?
A: There are always two <i>date-boxes</i> to filter for dates. The two boxes (each can be assigned with a different date) represent a <i>date-range</i>. When only filling out the 
first (left) date-box, all meta data will be shown after filtering, whose corresponding date is between the date you selected and today. When only filling out the second (right)
date-box, all meta data will be shown after filtering, whose corresponding date is between the beginning of records and your selected date. If you fill out both date-boxes, all meta
data will be shown after filtering, whose corresponding date is between your first selected date (left box) and your second selected date (right box). If you want to search for a 
specific date (e.g. filter all series from the January 9th 2024) both date-boxes have to contain the same date.

Q: How can I download data?
A: Therefore choose your data (by filtering) and then simply click on <b>Download</b>. All series and sample meta data that are shown on the webpage are downloaded in two tab-separated 
files (one containing the series meta data; the other containing the sample meta data). You can easily read them in, e.g. using R with the command: <i>read.delim("fileName", 
header=TRUE)</i>.

Q: How can I switch between different webpages?
A: There is a link to the other webpages in the top blue bar, next to the <b>Q&A</b> link. Those links are called <b>Internal data</b> and/or <b>GEO data</b> and/or <b>SRA data</b>.

Q: How does conditional filtering work?
A: Conditional filtering is pretty useful. You can then filter more effectively. There are three different conditional filter words: <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b> and <b>NOT</b>. You can 
combine them to filter within one filter criteria (e.g. title or summary). <b>Caution</b>: It is important to note that these conditional filter words only work when written in 
capital letters: <i>HSV AND HFF</i> will work, but <i>HSV and HFF</i> not! Also note that conditional filtering can't be used for characteristics and any term filter.

Q: How does the conditional filter word <b>AND</b> work?
A: With <i>AND</i>, you can filter for meta data that contain both (or more, if you have multiple AND) words in your chosen filter criteria. Write for example <i>HSV AND HFF</i> 
in the filter criteria <i>Series_title</i> of the series filter option to filter for all series that have the word <i>HSV</i> as well as <i>HFF</i> in their title. If a series 
has e.g. only HSV in its <i>title</i>, but not <i>HFF</i>, it will not appear after filtering.

Q: How does the conditional filter word <b>OR</b> work?
A: With <i>OR</i>, you can filter for meta data that contain only one or both (or more, if you have mutliple OR) word(s) in your chosen filter criteria. Write for example <i>ChIp OR
Atac</i> in the filter criteria <i>Series_overall_design</i> of the series filter option to filter for all series that have either the word <i>ChIp</i> or <i>Atac</i> or both in its
overall design. 

Q: How does the conditional filter word <b>NOT</b> work?
A: First to note is that the conditional filter word <i>NOT</i> has to be always combined with another conditional filter word (<i>AND</i> or <i>OR</i>), unless it is used alone.
E.g. <i>NOT ChIp</i> is correct, whereas <i>ChiP NOT Atac</i> is incorrect.
You can specify words with <i>NOT</i>, the meta data should not contain. Write e.g. <i>ChIp AND NOT Atac</i> in the filter criteria <i>Series_overall_design</i> of the series filter
option to filter for all series that contain the word <i>ChIp</i>, but not the word <i>Atac</i> in their overall design. If a series hasn't <i>ChiP</i> in its overall design or contains
the word <i>ChIp</i> but also <i>Atac</i> in its overall design, the series won't be shown after filtering.
